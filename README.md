A simple, Raspberry Pi based weather station, that posts to a WordPress blog. See my [blog post](https://qrys.ch/a-raspberry-pi-based-weather-station-posting-to-wordpress/) for details and how to install it.


 - `Si7021.py` is a PiGPIO-based sensor reader
 - `WeatherPress.py` is the implementation for this project.
